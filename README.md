## Problem 45 - Triangular, Pentagonal, and Hexagonal

Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following formulae:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Triangle</td>
<td><img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=T_n = n(n%2b1)/2"></td>
<td>1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...</td>
</tr>
<td>Pentagonal</td>
<td><img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=P_n = n(3n%2d1)/2"></td>
<td>1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ...</td>
</tr>
<td>Hexagonal</td>
<td><img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=H_n = n(2n%2d1)"></td>
<td>1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ...</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

It can be verified that <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=T_{285} = P_{165} = H_{143} = 40755">.

Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.
